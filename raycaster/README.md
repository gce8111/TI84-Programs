# Map Generation
you can edit the map by creating a csv file in the "maps" folder. Use 1 to represent open space, and 0 to represent a wall. See included test csv file for an example.

Once you edited a map run the following command:
`python MapGen.py .\Maps\yourmap.csv`
(the python script is written for windows, if you're on a unix system you will have to edit the path structures)
